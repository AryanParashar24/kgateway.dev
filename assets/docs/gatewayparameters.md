GatewayParameters is a {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} custom resource that specifies the configuration for the gateway proxies in your cluster. 

When you install {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}}, a GatewayParameters resource is automatically created for you. You can review its configuration by using the following command:  
```sh
kubectl get gatewayparameters gloo-gateway -n gloo-system -o yaml  
```

To spin up new gateway proxies, the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} controller uses a [gateway proxy template](#gatewayproxytemplate) and the configuration in the default GatewayParameters and [Settings](#settings) resources. You can change the default configuration for your gateway proxies by manually editing the GatewayParameters resource or adding the respective values to the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} Helm chart. You can also create additional GatewayParameters resources to spin up different types of gateway proxies.

For example, you might want to pair your gateway with a Network Load Balancer (NLB) instance in AWS. To properly pair and configure the gateway with an NLB, specific annotations on the gateway proxy are required. These annotations are not included in the default GatewayParameters resource. To add them, you can either change the default GatewayParameters resource, or create a separate one where you add these annotations.
