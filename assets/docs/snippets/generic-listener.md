Optionally, you can configure a listener that is specific to the Gateway. Note that due to a [Gateway API limitation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1713/#gateway-changes), you must configure at least one listener on the Gateway resource, even if the listener is not used and is a generic, "dummy" listener. This generic listener cannot conflict with the listener that you configure in the ListenerSet, such as using the same port or name.
