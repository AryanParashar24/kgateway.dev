The following example walks you through how to use an Inja template to extract a value from a request header and to add this value as a header to your responses.

## Inject response headers
   
1. Create a TrafficPolicy resource with your transformation rules. Make sure to create the TrafficPolicy in the same namespace as the HTTPRoute resource. In the following example, you use the value from the `x-kgateway-request` request header and populate the value of that header into an `x-kgateway-response` response header.
   
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: TrafficPolicy
   metadata:
     name: transformation
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     transformation:
       response:
         set:
         - name: x-kgateway-response
           value: '{{ request_header("x-kgateway-request") }}' 
   EOF
   ```

2. Update the HTTPRoute resource to apply the TrafficPolicy to the httpbin route by using an `extensionRef` filter.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin
     namespace: httpbin
     labels:
       example: httpbin-route
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - name: http
         namespace: kgateway-system
     hostnames:
       - "www.example.com"
     rules:
       - backendRefs:
           - name: httpbin
             port: 8000
         filters:
         - type: ExtensionRef
           extensionRef:
             group: gateway.kgateway.dev
             kind: TrafficPolicy
             name: transformation
   EOF
   ```

3. Send a request to the httpbin app and include the `x-kgateway-request` request header.
   
   {{< tabs items="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vi http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/response-headers \
    -H "host: www.example.com:8080" \
    -H "x-kgateway-request: my custom request header" 
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vi localhost:8080/response-headers \
   -H "host: www.example.com" \
   -H "x-kgateway-request: my custom request header"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}
   
   In the example output, verify the following:
   
   * The `x-kgateway-request` request header is included in the request.
   * The request is successful and returns a 200 HTTP response code.
   * The `x-kgateway-response` response header is included in the response and has the same value as the `x-kgateway-request` request header.

   ```yaml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[10,14,32],linenostart=1}
   * Host <host-address>:8080 was resolved.
   * IPv6: ::1
   * IPv4: 127.0.0.1
   *   Trying [::1]:8080...
   * Connected to <host-address> (::1) port 8080
   > GET /response-headers HTTP/1.1
   > Host: www.example.com
   > User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
   > Accept: */*
   > x-kgateway-request: my custom request header
   > 
   * Request completely sent off
   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK

   ```
   
## Cleanup

{{< reuse "docs/snippets/cleanup.md" >}}

1. Delete the TrafficPolicy resource.

   ```sh
   kubectl delete TrafficPolicy transformation -n httpbin
   ```
   
2. Remove the `extensionRef` filter from the HTTPRoute resource.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin
     namespace: httpbin
     labels:
       example: httpbin-route
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - name: http
         namespace: kgateway-system
     hostnames:
       - "www.example.com"
     rules:
       - backendRefs:
           - name: httpbin
             port: 8000
   EOF
   ```
