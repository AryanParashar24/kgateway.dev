## Known limitations

**Gateway-level policy in 2.1.x or later**: To apply transformations to all the routes on a Gateway, you must use kgateway version `2.1.0-main` or later. Then, you can select the Gateway in the `targetRefs` field of the TrafficPolicy. Remember that you can configure route-specific transformations by creating another TrafficPolicy with the `targetRefs` field set to the specific HTTPRoute. The HTTPRoute-level policy takes precedence over the Gateway-level policy.
