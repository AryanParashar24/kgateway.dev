Permanently redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. 

For more information, see the [{{< reuse "docs/snippets/k8s-gateway-api-name.md" >}} documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/httproute/#filters-optional).

## Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS

1. Create an HTTP route for the httpbin app that you set up as part of the [Get started guide](/docs/quickstart/). In the following example, all HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS, and a 301 HTTP response code is returned to the user. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin-https-redirect
     namespace: httpbin
     labels:
       example: httpbin-route
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - name: http
         namespace: gloo-system
     hostnames: 
       - redirect.example
     rules:
       - filters:
         - type: RequestRedirect
           requestRedirect:
             scheme: https
             statusCode: 301
   EOF  
   ```

   |Setting|Description|
   |--|--|
   |`spec.parentRefs.name`|The name and namespace of the gateway resource that serves the route. In this example, you use the gateway that you installed as part of the [Get started guide](/docs/quickstart). |
   |`spec.hostnames`| The hostname for which you want to apply the redirect.|
   |`spec.rules.filters.type`|The type of filter that you want to apply to incoming requests. In this example, the `RequestRedirect` is used.|
   |`spec.rules.filters.requestRedirect.scheme`|The type of redirect that you want to apply. The `https` scheme redirects all incoming traffic to HTTPS. |
   |`spec.rules.filters.requestRedirect.statusCode`|The HTTP status code that you want to return to the client in case of a redirect. For a permanent redirect, use the 301 HTTP status code.   |

2. Send a request to the httpbin app on the `redirect.example` domain. Verify that you get back a 301 HTTP response code and that your redirect location shows `https://redirect.example:8080/status/200`.
