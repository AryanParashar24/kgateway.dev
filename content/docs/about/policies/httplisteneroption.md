You can use an HttpListenerOption resource to attach policies to one, multiple, or all HTTP or HTTPs listeners on the gateway.=]['/]

## Policy attachment {#policy-attachment-listeneroption}

Learn more about how you can attach policies to HTTP or HTTPS listeners. 

### Option 1: Attach the policy to all listeners on the gateway (`targetRefs`)

You can apply a policy to all HTTP and HTTPS listeners that are defined on the gateway by using the `spec.targetRefs` section in the HttpListenerOption resource. 

The following HTTPListenerOption resource configures Envoy HTTPConnectionManager settings on a Gateway resource that is named `http`. Because no listener is targeted, the policy applies to all the HTTP and HTTPS listeners that are defined on the gateway. 

```console {hl_lines=[7,8,9,10]} 
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: HttpListenerOption
metadata:
  name: server-name
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  targetRefs:
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: http
  options:
    httpConnectionManagerSettings:
      serverName: "myserver"
```


### Option 2: Attach the policy to a particular listener on the gateway (`targetRefs.sectionName`)

Instead of attaching a policy to all the HTTP and HTTPs listeners that are defined on the gateway, you can target a particular HTTP or HTTPS listener by using the `spec.targetRefs.sectionName` field in the HttpListenerOption resource. 

The following Gateway resource defines two listeners, an HTTP (`http`) and HTTPS (`https`) listener. 

```console {hl_lines=[8,15]} 
kind: Gateway
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: http
spec:
  gatewayClassName: gloo-gateway
  listeners:
  - name: http
    protocol: HTTP
    port: 8080
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: All
    hostname: www.example.com
  - name: https
    port: 443
    protocol: HTTPS
    hostname: https.example.com
    tls:
      mode: Terminate
      certificateRefs:
        - name: https
          kind: Secret
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: All
```

To apply the policy to only the `https` listener, you specify the listener name in the `spec.targetRefs.sectionName` field in the HttpListenerOption resource as shown in the following example. 

```console {hl_lines=[11]} 
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: HttpListenerOption
metadata:
  name: server-name
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  targetRefs:
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: http
    sectionName: https
  options:
    httpConnectionManagerSettings:
      serverName: "myserver"
```


## Conflicting policies

If you create multiple HttpListenerOption resources and attach them to the same gateway listener by using the `targetRefs` option, only the HttpListenerOption that was first created is applied. 

{{% callout type="info" %}}
You cannot attach multiple HttpListenerOption resources to the same listener, *even if* they define different top-level policies. To add multiple policies, define them in the same HttpListenerOption resource.
{{% /callout %}}

In the following image, you want to attach two HttpListenerOption resources to the HTTP listener. One configures local rate limiting and the other one configures a CSRF policy. Because only one HttpListenerOption can be attached to a gateway listener via `targetRefs` at any given time, only the policy that is created first is enforced (policy 1).
