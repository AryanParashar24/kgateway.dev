Configure and manage the connections to an upstream service. 

## About backend connections

The BackendConfigPolicy allows you to define settings for a connection to an upstream service. These settings include general settings, such as connection timeouts or the maximum number of connections that an upstream service can receive. But it also allows you to configure TCP keepalive to identiy and handle stale connections. 

* [General connection settings](#general-settings)
* [TCP keepalive](#keepalive)
* [HTTP protocol options](#http)
* [Additional HTTP 1.0 protocol options](#http1)

### General connection settings {#general-settings}

Configure the timeout and read/write buffer limits for a connection. 

```yaml 
kind: BackendConfigPolicy
apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: httpbin-policy
  namespace: gwtest
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - name: httpbin
      group: ""
      kind: Service
  connectTimeout: 5s
  perConnectionBufferLimitBytes: 1024
```

| Setting | Description | 
| -- | -- | 
| `connectTimeout` | The timeout for new network connections to an upstream service. | 
| `perConnectionBufferLimitBytes` | Set the size of the read and write buffer per connection. By default, kgateway is set up with 1MiB of request read and write buffer for each connection. For large requests that must be buffered and that exceed the default buffer limit, kgateway either disconnects the connection to the downstream service if headers were already sent, or returns a 500 HTTP response code. To make sure that large requests can be sent and received, you can specify the maximum number of bytes that you want to allow to be buffered between the gateway and the downstream service. | 


### TCP keepalive {#keepalive}

With keepalive, the kernel sends probe packets with only an acknowledgement flag (ACK) to the TCP socket of the destination after the connection was idle for a specific amount of time. This way, the connection does not have to be re-established repeatedly, which could otherwise lead to latency spikes. If the destination returns the packet with an acknowledgement flag (ACK), the connection is determined to be alive. If not, the probe can fail a certain number of times before the connection is considered stale. kgateway can then close the stale connection, which can help avoid longer timeouts and retries on broken or stale connections. 

You can use the BackendConfigPolicy to keep connections alive and avoid 503 errors. 

| Setting | Description | 
| -- | -- | 
| `keepAliveProbes` | The maximum number of keepalive probes to send without a response before a connection is considered stale. | 
| `keepAliveTime` | The number of seconds a connection needs to be idle before keep-alive probes are sent. |
| `keepAliveInterval` | The number of seconds between keep-alive probes.  | 

```yaml
kind: BackendConfigPolicy
apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: httpbin-policy
  namespace: gwtest
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - name: httpbin
      group: ""
      kind: Service
  tcpKeepalive:
    keepAliveProbes: 3
    keepAliveTime: 30s
    keepAliveInterval: 5s
```

### HTTP protocol options {#http}

You can use a BackendConfigPolicy to configure additional connection options when handling upstream HTTP requests. Note that these options are applied to HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 requests. 

```yaml
kind: BackendConfigPolicy
apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: httpbin-policy
  namespace: gwtest
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - name: httpbin
      group: ""
      kind: Service
  commonHttpProtocolOptions:
    idleTimeout: 10s  
    maxHeadersCount: 15
    maxStreamDuration: 30s
    maxRequestsPerConnection: 100 
    headersWithUnderscoresAction: RejectRequest
```

| Setting | Description | 
| -- | -- | 
| `idleTimeout` | The idle timeout for connections. The idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no active requests. When the idle timeout is reached the connection is closed. Note that request based timeouts mean that HTTP/2 PINGs will not keep the connection alive. If not specified, this defaults to 1 hour. To disable idle timeouts explicitly set this to 0. Warning: Disabling this timeout has a highly likelihood of yielding connection leaks due to lost TCP FIN packets, etc. | 
| `maxHeadersCount` | The maximum number of headers that can be sent in a connection. If unconfigured, the number defaults to 100. Requests that exceed this limit receive a 431 response for HTTP/1.x and cause a stream reset for HTTP/2. | 
| `maxStreamDuration` | The total duration to keep alive an HTTP request/response stream. If the time limit is reached the stream is reset independent of any other timeouts. If not specified, this value is not set. | 
| `maxRequestsPerConnection` | The maximum number of requests that can be sent per connection. | 
| `headersWithUnderscoresAction` | The action to take when a client request with a header name is received that includes underscore characters. If not specified, the value defaults to `ALLOW`. | 

#### Additional HTTP 1.0 protocol options {#http1}

The BackendConfigPolicy allows you to apply additional configuration to HTTP/1 connections. 

```yaml
kind: BackendConfigPolicy
apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: httpbin-policy
  namespace: gwtest
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - name: httpbin
      group: ""
      kind: Service
  http1ProtocolOptions:
    enableTrailers: true
    overrideStreamErrorOnInvalidHttpMessage: true
    headerFormat: PreserveCaseHeaderKeyFormat
```

| Setting | Description | 
| -- | -- | 
| `enableTrailers` | Enables trailers for HTTP/1 requests. Trailers are headers that are sent after the request body is sent. By default, the HTTP/1 codec drops proxied trailers. | 
| `overrideStreamErrorOnInvalidHttpMessage` | When set to false, kgateway terminates HTTP/1.1 connections when an invalid HTTP message is received, such as malformatted headers. When set to true, kgateway leaves the HTTP/1.1 connection open where possible. | 
| `headerFormat` | By default, kgateway normalizes header keys to lowercase. Set to `PreserveCaseHeaderKeyFormat` to preserve the original casing after the request is proxied. Set to `properCaseHeaderKeyFormat` to capitalize the first character and any character following a special character if itâ€™s an alpha character. For example, `content-type` becomes `Content-Type`, and `foo$b#$are` becomes `Foo$B#$Are`. |

## Configure backend connections

1. Create a BackendConfigPolicy that applies connection configuration to the httpbin app. 
   ```yaml 
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   kind: BackendConfigPolicy
   apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   metadata:
     name: httpbin-connection
     namespace: httpbin   
   spec:
     targetRefs:
       - name: httpbin
         group: ""
         kind: Service
     connectTimeout: 5s
     perConnectionBufferLimitBytes: 1024
     commonHttpProtocolOptions:
       idleTimeout: 10s  
       maxHeadersCount: 15
       maxStreamDuration: 30s
       maxRequestsPerConnection: 100 
       headersWithUnderscoresAction: RejectRequest
     tcpKeepalive:
       keepAliveProbes: 3
       keepAliveTime: 30s
       keepAliveInterval: 5s
     http1ProtocolOptions:
       enableTrailers: true
       overrideStreamErrorOnInvalidHttpMessage: true
       headerFormat: PreserveCaseHeaderKeyFormat
   EOF
   ```   

2. Port-forward the gateway proxy on port 19000. 
   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward deployment/http -n kgateway-system 19000
   ```
   
3. Get the configuration of your gateway proxy as a config dump. 
   ```sh
   curl -X POST 127.0.0.1:19000/config_dump\?include_eds > gateway-config.json
   ```
   
4. Open the config dump and find the `kube_httpbin_httpbin_8000` cluster. Verify that you see all the connection settings that you enabled in your BackendConfigPolicy.
