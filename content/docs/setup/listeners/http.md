{{< callout type="info" >}}
If you followed the [Get started guide](/docs/quickstart/), you already have a gateway named `http` in the `gloo-system` namespace of your cluster. This gateway can be used as the main ingress for the apps in your cluster. HTTPRoutes can refer to this gateway independent of the namespace they are in. To create more gateways, use the instructions in this guide. 
{{< /callout >}}

1. Create a gateway resource with an HTTP listener. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
     name: my-http-gateway
     namespace: gloo-system
     labels:
       example: httpbin-mydomain
   spec:
     gatewayClassName: gloo-gateway
     listeners:
     - protocol: HTTP
       port: 8080
       hostname: mydomain.com
       name: http
       allowedRoutes:
         namespaces:
           from: All
   EOF
   ```

   |Setting|Description|
   |--|--|
   |`spec.gatewayClassName`|The name of the Kubernetes gateway class that you want to use to configure the gateway. When you set up {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}}, a default gateway class is set up for you.  |
   |`spec.listeners`|Configure the listeners for this gateway. In this example, you configure an HTTP gateway that listens for incoming traffic for the `mydomain.com` domain on port 8080. The gateway can serve HTTP routes from any namespace. |

2. Check the status of the gateway to make sure that your configuration is accepted and no conflicts exist in your cluster. 
   ```sh
   kubectl get gateway my-http-gateway -n gloo-system -o yaml
   ```

3. Create an HTTPRoute resource for the httpbin app that is served by the gateway that you created.
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin-mydomain
     namespace: httpbin
     labels:
       example: httpbin-mydomain
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - name: my-http-gateway
         namespace: gloo-system
     rules:
       - backendRefs:
           - name: httpbin
             port: 8000
   EOF
   ```

4. Verify that the HTTPRoute is applied successfully. 
   ```sh
   kubectl get httproute/httpbin-mydomain -n httpbin -o yaml
   ```

5. Get the external address of the gateway and save it in an environment variable.
   {{< tabs items="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   export INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS=$(kubectl get svc -n gloo-system gloo-proxy-my-http-gateway -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0]['hostname','ip']}")
   echo $INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS   
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward deployment/gloo-proxy-my-http-gateway -n gloo-system 8080:8080
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

6. Send a request to the httpbin app and verify that you get back a 200 HTTP response code. 
   {{< tabs items="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vik http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/status/200 -H "host: mydomain.com:8080" 
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vik localhost:8080/status/200 -H "host: mydomain.com"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}
   

   Example output: 
   ```console
   * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   < access-control-allow-credentials: true
   access-control-allow-credentials: true
   < access-control-allow-origin: *
   access-control-allow-origin: *
   < date: Fri, 03 Nov 2023 20:02:48 GMT
   date: Fri, 03 Nov 2023 20:02:48 GMT

   content-length: 0
   < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 1
   x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 1
   < server: envoy
   server: envoy
   ```

7. Optional: If you no longer need the HTTP listener, clean up the resources that you created.

   ```shell
   kubectl delete -A gateways,httproutes -l example=httpbin-mydomain
   ```
